# Day-3: Advanced Python Concepts

## Overview
This directory covers advanced Python topics including OOP principles, data structures, and error handling.

## Files

### Core Topics
- **inheritance.py** - Object-oriented programming with inheritance and polymorphism
- **inheritance.ipynb** - Interactive notebook exploring inheritance concepts
- **dataclass.py** - Using Python dataclasses for cleaner class definitions
- **exceptionhandling.py** - Exception handling patterns and best practices
- **common_occurance.py** - Problem-solving: finding common elements

### Learning Materials
- **notebook.ipynb** - Additional interactive examples and exercises

## Key Concepts
- ✓ Inheritance & Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- ✓ Data Classes for simplified data structures
- ✓ Exception handling (try, except, finally, custom exceptions)
- ✓ Algorithm optimization (common occurrence detection)

## Running the Code
```bash
# Run Python scripts
python inheritance.py
python dataclass.py
python exceptionhandling.py
python common_occurance.py

# Run Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook inheritance.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

## Learning Path
1. Start with inheritance concepts (`.py` and `.ipynb`)
2. Explore dataclass patterns for cleaner code
3. Master exception handling for robust applications
4. Solve algorithmic challenges (common occurrence)
