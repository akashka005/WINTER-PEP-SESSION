# Day 4 — Portfolio Project

This folder contains the portfolio web project used in Day 4 of the workshop.

- Purpose: build a small Django portfolio app with templates, static assets, and a core app.
- Quick start: create a virtualenv, install requirements from `requirements.txt`, then run:

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

- Notes: production settings and a sample `reset_admin.py` helper are included in the folder.
